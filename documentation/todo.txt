# Core
try to fix problem with socketIo HIGH PRIORITY
max DataChannel brandwitdth, is it 30kbs ?
allow uploaded node_modules require not juste standards ones
get paramters with ?a=b&z=3
add socket io support (inside browser server)
re-enable window.addEventListener("error" if necessary for worker error catching
change + host to the new paradigm


# UX
increase check box
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41796027/is-there-a-browser-agnostic-way-to-increase-a-checkboxs-size-without-changing-h
make index.js the default server program
warnBeforeLeave should be false by default
connecting ... make it fail faster
add enter to send message
more accurate connected state
provide more feedback
http://danml.com/download.html for mobile download without opening a new tab
oading experience display an erro while loading ... not good (invisble if less than 0.5 second, very bad UX otherwise)

# Improvements

gzip data and use a cache for static files on server-side
if time make body parser closer to what it is,
! after loading multiple files including a package json remove use a node program checkbox
! make require work with custom scripts that are imported
service worker claim does not always work ?
full template strings escape in tools for worker
visit https://github.com/jvilk/BrowserFS
port the next thing in node
translate projects
make it work without server after the first time, if there are enough users connected
make sdp offer before needed, so that it is instant
cache external_dependencies ?

# Refactoring

you have 4 places or 3 where headerBodyObject is forwarded, could you reuse some code harmonize the API make shema with arrows to see where it is forwarded, maybe good idea to use <new Header and Response ? high priority this will help large file sending (currently data is not received 100% the same)
centralize state more
build process faster, now it is slow because it restarts nodejs 1-5 times every time
see if https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/webkitdirectory is usable instead of zip
store peers info in localstorage, do not request same info twice
